## About the App
![App Logo](readmeImages/mockup1.png)
### App Description
FaceFit Meadow is a revolutionary React Native app designed to inspire and assist children facing unique health challenges, such as Facial Nerve Palsy and Neuromuscular Disorders. It transforms facial therapy and facial exercise into an enjoyable and engaging experience.

FaceFit Meadow introduces a virtual pet, your therapy buddy, eager to embark on exciting adventures with you. By playing a game that simulates your pet's world, you engage in facial exercises that are not only entertaining but also therapeutic. The game uses advanced AI smile detection powered by Google's ML Kit, making it a fun and interactive way to improve your facial muscle strength and coordination.

**Key Features**
* Virtual pet companion for therapy
* Interactive game using facial exercises
* Smile detection with Google's ML Kit
* Progress tracking
* Motivational badges and rewards

### Concept Process
`Conceptual Process`

To kickstart the conceptual phase, I delved into the project brief, ensuring a clear and thorough understanding of the requirements and objectives.
![brief](readmeImages/1.png)

#### Brainstorm
Subsequently, I conducted a brainstorming session to identify potential problems I could address. My intention was to create something meaningful, and I have a particular interest in developing apps for children. This inspired me to create an app that could assist with therapy. Following numerous brainstorming sessions, I made the decision to develop a therapy app specifically for children, with a particular focus on facial therapy. As a result, I crafted the following "how might we" statement:
![hmw](readmeImages/2.png)

Once I was aware of the requirements and had come up with an idea, I was able to progress to the ideation process.

#### Idea Generation
I then came up with the idea of Facefitmeadow.

![idea](readmeImages/4.png)


## Development Process
The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

Once I had finalized the designs, the real fun began.

## Implementation Process
I utilized React Native, a free and open-source framework for mobile app development, to create this project. React Native enabled me to build the application using a single codebase, resulting in a cross-platform app.

Firebase, a comprehensive suite of backend services, was used for user authentication and storing app data. Firebase Authentication ensured secure user login and registration, while Firestore database provided a scalable and real-time storage solution.

Google ML Kit Face Detection, is an AI that scans a users face and is able to detect if the user is smiling or not.

* Utilized and implemented React Native for the frontend.
* Integrated Firebase for user authentication and data storage.
* Integrated Google ML Kit Face Detection
* Implemented user registration, login, and profile management features.

### The Functionality

### Above & Beyond
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Gamification - by implementing gamification features and tools, I explored functionality that we had previously not learnt.
* Interaction animations - hand made animations were created for the Spot interaction.
* Hand drawn illustrations - the entire application was illustrated by me.

### Reviews & Testing
In order to test the application I conducted a user testing session with my fellow classmates. Here I found that the application felt anti-climatic and needed more user friendly details during the sign in and registration process, such as view password. I then made the adjustments needed.

### Challenges, Highlights & learnings

#### Challenges
Facing the initial challenge of finding an idea that truly ignited my passion, I was determined to create something with a profound impact. However, working on a project that involved AI technology, particularly the integration of smile detection into the gaming experience, presented significant hurdles. It demanded numerous refinements and put my skills to the test. In the end, despite these challenges, I derived immense satisfaction from the final outcome, which represented a significant achievement for me.

#### Highlights
I can confidently say that this project was the highlight of my year. While it may not have been the simplest undertaking, I found immense enjoyment in every aspect of it. I viewed it as a genuine passion project, and witnessing the transformation of my concept into a gamified app was a truly amazing experience.

#### Learnings
This project served as a remarkable learning experience, particularly in the realm of AI and its practical implementation. I gained valuable insights into how AI can be harnessed as a powerful tool for creating positive impact. Additionally, it highlighted how the experiences throughout the year have equipped me to tackle any project I set my mind to.

#### Future Implementation
In future, I would like to add more games that require different facial exercises. I would also like to take the interactions with Spot a step further.
